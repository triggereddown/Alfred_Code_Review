You have two syntax errors in your JavaScript code:

1. **Unclosed string literal:** The string `"Alice` is missing its closing double quote.
2. **Typo in `console.log`:** It's misspelled as `console.logg`.

Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
const name = "Alice"; // Added closing double quote and a semicolon (good practice)
console.log("Hello, " + name); // Corrected 'logg' to 'log'
```

**Explanation of the fixes:**

- `const name = "Alice";` : In JavaScript (and most programming languages), a string must begin and end with matching
  quotes (either single `''` or double `""`). You had ` "Alice` but were missing the final `"` to close the string.
- `console.log("Hello, " + name);` : The standard function to print output to the console in JavaScript is
  `console.log()`, not `console.logg()`.
